@inproceedings{Yan2024SolderlessPCB,
  abstract = {The iterative prototyping process for printed circuit boards (PCBs) frequently employs surface-mounted device (SMD) components, which are often discarded rather than reused due to the challenges associated with desoldering, leading to unnecessary electronic waste. This paper introduces SolderlessPCB, a collection of techniques for solder-free PCB prototyping, specifically designed to promote the recycling and reuse of electronic components. Central to this approach are custom 3D-printable housings that allow SMD components to be mounted onto PCBs without soldering. We detail the design of SolderlessPCB and the experiments conducted to evaluate its design parameters, electrical performance, and durability. To illustrate the potential for reusing SMD components with SolderlessPCB, we discuss two scenarios: the reuse of components from earlier design iterations and from obsolete prototypes. We also provide examples demonstrating that SolderlessPCB can handle high-current applications and is suitable for high-speed data transmission. The paper concludes by discussing the limitations of our approach and suggesting future directions to overcome these challenges.},

  abstract = {This research explores the concept of a "more-than-human right-to-repair" framework that extends beyond consumer rights to acknowledge the environmental and ecological implications of electronic product repairability. We employ critical theory and policy analysis to examine how repair rights intersect with environmental justice and sustainability goals, evaluating existing legislation and industry practices through this expanded philosophical lens. Through case studies of repair movements and barriers, our study reveals that current right-to-repair approaches remain predominantly anthropocentric, failing to adequately address the ecological dimensions of electronics consumption. The findings suggest that reconceptualizing repair rights to include non-human stakeholders could lead to more comprehensive policy frameworks that better address the environmental externalities of electronic waste while encouraging more sustainable design and consumption patterns.},
